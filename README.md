Experimental attempt at creating a developer workstation by including all of:

* Minikube
* SUSE CAP - SCF Eirini release (experimental at time of writing)
* openSUSE Tumbleweed as KVM server

The intent is to be able to minimize the needed resource footprint so that is can be used by the average developer at will, ideally as part of a larger CF environment.
